# New York Citi Bike Data
Data Bootcamp week 15 - Tableau

## Overview of Analysis
This exercise involved analyzing data from a provided csv file using Tableau Public. The data represents information about New York City's bikesharing program (Citi Bike), and we were asked to use this data to help make a case for replicating this program in Des Moines, Iowa.

For the guided homework portion of the exercise, I produced multiple data visualizations of different types and combined four of them in a Tableau Dashboard.

For the independent challenge portion of the exercise, I:

* Used Python and Pandas to convert tripduration data from an integer to a dateime datatype (i.e., turning it into a time with hours, minutes, and seconds);
* Created five additional visualizations; and
* Compiled selected visualizations from the homework and the independent challenge into a Tableau Story.

## Results
* at least 7 visualizations
* description of results for each viz

## Summary
* high level summary 
* two additional viz for future analysis
